# X-Total-Count Header for Sails.js 0.12

This blueprint adds a X-Total-Count header with the total number of records to every response in Sails.js v0.12. This is useful for pagination and stuff...

I'm uploading this to Github because i've already spent like 12 hours looking for a nice way to do this.


Just put this file in api/blueprints/find.js.
